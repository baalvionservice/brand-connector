const BRAND_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How does the escrow payment system work?",
    answer: "Our secure escrow system holds your campaign budget safely once you hire a creator. Funds are only released to the creator after you've reviewed and approved the final deliverables, ensuring total peace of mind for your marketing spend."
  },
  {
    question: "How are creators verified on Baalvion?",
    answer: "Every creator undergoes a multi-step verification process. We verify their social media ownership, analyze their historical engagement data to detect bot activity, and review their past professional collaborations to ensure high-quality standards."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the AI Matching Engine and how accurate is it?",
    answer: "Our proprietary AI analyzes millions of data points, including audience demographics, content sentiment, and historical ROI. It matches brands with creators whose audience perfectly aligns with their target market, achieving up to 95% higher engagement compared to manual searching."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I set specific campaign requirements and deliverables?",
    answer: "Absolutely. When creating a campaign, you can define exact deliverables (e.g., 1 Reel, 2 Stories), specific keywords to use, content format requirements, and even visual guidelines to ensure brand consistency."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I track the ROI of my influencer campaigns?",
    answer: "Baalvion provides a real-time analytics dashboard for every campaign. Track clicks, conversions, total reach, and cost-per-acquisition (CPA) directly within the platform using our integrated tracking tools."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any long-term contracts or hidden fees?",
    answer: "No. Baalvion operates on a transparent per-campaign basis. We have clear monthly subscription tiers for advanced features, but there are no hidden fees or long-term lock-ins. You pay for what you use."
  }
];

const CREATOR_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "When and how do I get paid for my work?",
    answer: "Payments are processed automatically once the brand approves your submitted deliverables. The funds are already in escrow, so you never have to chase invoices. You can withdraw your earnings via Bank Transfer, PayPal, or Stripe."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Baalvion match me with relevant brand campaigns?",
    answer: "Our AI considers your niche, audience location, engagement style, and previous campaign success. You'll receive invitations to campaigns that genuinely fit your brand, making every collaboration more authentic and effective."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it free for creators to join and apply for campaigns?",
    answer: "Yes, it is 100% free for creators to join Baalvion, build a professional portfolio, and apply to campaigns. We only take a small platform fee from the final payment to cover secure transaction costs."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a brand requests multiple revisions?",
    answer: "Our platform guidelines specify a standard number of revisions (usually one). If a brand requires more, our support team can mediate or help you adjust the project scope and budget accordingly through our built-in messaging system."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage multiple social media accounts from one profile?",
    answer: "Yes! You can connect and manage all your major social platforms—Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn, and more—from a single Baalvion dashboard, giving brands a complete view of your cross-platform reach."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the rating system affect my visibility to brands?",
    answer: "Creators who consistently deliver on time and receive positive feedback from brands earn higher ratings. Higher-rated creators are prioritized in our AI matching engine and are more likely to be featured in 'Top Talent' showcases."
